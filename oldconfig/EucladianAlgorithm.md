Euclidean Algorithm is a computanioal process of finding a gcd of 2
numbers

example gcd of (54,888)

gcs(54,888) first takes the bigger number to divide it with the smaller n
number 

example 

888/54 = 16 remain 24 
888 = 54(16) + 24 <-- the remainder

then take the 54 as the role of 888 and divide it with the 24
54 = 24(2) + 6 <-- the remainder

Then repeat the same step take the 24 as the role of 54 and divide 
with the remainder which is 6 

24 = 6(4) + 0

Now we reached where there's no remainder which is 0 so according to 
the euclidian algorithm 
**the remainder value before we reached no remainder
value is the Greatest Common Divisor** so that the conclusion is that
6 is the the Greatest Common Divisor 

another example 

find gdb of (7,876543) 

876543 = 7(1235220) + 3 <-- the remainder
7 = 3(2) + 1 <-- the gcd
3 = 1(3) + 0 <-- no remainder so 1 is the gcd
